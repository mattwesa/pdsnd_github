### Programm
Basic Data Exploration with pandas on Bikeshare Data
A Python project using pandas to explore bikeshare data.
This task was part of my UDACITY Programming for DATA SCIENCE from August 2021 until January 2022

### Description
The program loads and merges the available data, after that the filtering section starts where the user can choose between city, user type, month, day of month and day of week.
Once the filter section is completed, the data is been filtered and post-processed in the static section. 
The statics show the following data:
Most popular month, day of week, hour of the day
Most popular start and end station and most popular trip
Total and average trip duration
Types of users (subscriber or customer) and gender (if available)
The oldest, youngest and most common birth year (if available)
Finally, the user can decide to have a closer look on the data and/or restart the filtering process.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
Special thanks to my friend Christoph Lauterbach for helping me building this code and to my wife for giving me so much patience.
